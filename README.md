Visualizing the long term relationship between Inflation and economic growth using Costa Rica as case study

Firstly, we visualize  both inflation and economic growth in terms of a time series plot after which we plot the relationship between the two variables using a scatter plot.
Using both linear fit (OLS) and non linear fit (GAMS), we see a negative relationship between the two variables.

Next we use both HP filter and BK fiter to extract the term in order to analyze the long term relationship between the variables.

Using the the trend term from the HP filter, we observe a negative relationship betwen inflation and growth. 

However the results from the BK filter shows somehow complicated relationship between the long term inflation and growth.
we observe an oscilating relationship between the variable (positive at some point and negative at other points).
This provides some indication of growth fatigue as inflation increases
